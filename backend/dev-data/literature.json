Using recently opened intelligence archives, the book traces Dai's rise from a rural troublemaker to the head of the world's largest spy organization. It reveals the tactics used by the secret police, including death squads, kidnappings, torture, and surveillance, to intimidate critics of the government. The book sheds light on China's Republican era and the start of the Cold War, highlighting the cooperation between Chinese and American special services operatives. It also explains how Dai Li's anti-Communist activities altered the balance of power, leading to Mao Zedong's rise to leadership. Finally, the book discusses how the Chinese adapted foreign methods and traditional techniques to create their modern intelligence service."

The author examines the confrontation and collaboration between the Nationalist secret police and the Shanghai underworld. The book covers topics such as social controls, regional differences, imperialism, and power struggles among different consular police. Despite Chiang Kai-shek's efforts to reclaim the city from foreign powers, his failure was partly due to the Nationalist police force's corruption. Wakeman's study is a significant contribution to the study of Nationalist regime and modern Chinese urban history."
