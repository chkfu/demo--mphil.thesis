        CPA was nominally under the ruler Chiang Kai-shek's control; in fact, the whompoa graduates Li Shi-zhen and Dai Li dominated the academy management and supervision respectively.
        <br /><br />
        Li, leader of Nanking clique, was the dean who managed the whole academy with his professional knowledge;
        Dai, leader of Chekiang clique, the officer of School Affairs Committee with his influence over the police sector.
        <br /><br />
        Considering Li's stable control, Chekiang leaders therefore challenged the regular system by the resumption of Special Police programmes.
        As means of counterattack, they promoted their special police cadres and even intervened academy development with their superiority at police agencies.
